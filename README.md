The Financial Freedom Consulting chrome extension is a way to track your budgeting and stop impulsive spending.

It works by scraping through Amazon, Best Buy, E-Bay and Nike and grabbing the name and item price in the checkout menu. The information collected is then fed into the Gemini API where depending on the budget you set, your budget percentage and level of severity you selescted will generate playfull insults ranging in intensity. These insults are there to make you second guess your spending and focus on your budgeting and engineered to help you save your money.
